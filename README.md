# impedance-matching

The impedance of output should match the impedance of the load to maximise the energy transfer.

## Amplifier example 

If the amplifier is rated for 8 ohms, then you should choose an 8-ohm speaker. However, in general, it's also important to consider the damping factor for optimal performance.

Damping factor means how fast the amplifier can control the cone of the speaak. It means more control on sound.

Damping factor = Speaker impedance / Amplifier output impedance

DF = 8/0.08 = 100

This is great. A DF of 50–100+ is considered excellent.

## How to measure the impedance and damping factor of the amplifier?



## Measure the output impedance 
You can estimate the output impedance with a load test:
1. Measure the amp’s output voltage with no load (V₀)
2. Connect a known resistor (like an 8Ω dummy load) and measure the loaded voltage (V₁)
3. Use the formula:
out= load * (V₀ - V₁)/V₁
